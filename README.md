# Todo-List

## Overview
A simple todo-list helpful for logging completed tasks, and tasks still to-do with a deadline and priority. 

## Status
It's fully functional but unfinished. Right now there is no concrete plan to come back to this project, but I would like to implement some ideas in the future if there is time. 

## Purpose
This was my first Python project to build something new. It's simplistic yet open-ended nature made it a perfect transtion from course heavy learning to building something.

## Features
- A menu system that can be traversed using `while` loops.
- Holds extra task details such as: description, deadline, priority, and time set. 
- Ability to change task details of a task once created.
- User has the ability to view `action history` and `undo` last action. 
- Task data is saved to file so programme functions outside of runtime. 

## Future Plans
- Modularisation into seperate files. 
- Make the print statements more UX-friendly.
- Write some unit tests.
- Add a `redo` function. 

## What I Learned
- How to employ `while` loops in user-inputs for validation and forcing a correct input. 
- Why certain data storage structures are better than others. 

## How to Run

```bash
python3 todo_list.py
